# README: Shortest Path Algorithm Notebook

---

## Overview

Welcome to the Shortest Path Algorithm Notebook! This repository is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts and implementations of various shortest path algorithms. Whether you're a beginner or seeking a refresher, this resource aims to provide you with comprehensive tutorials, code examples, GIFs, videos, and more.

## Subjects Covered

1. **Heap and Priority Queue (Construction of Dijkstra)**
   - Understand the importance of heaps and priority queues in implementing Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Dive into one of the most popular and widely used algorithms for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

3. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Explore the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which handles graphs with negative edge weights and detects negative cycles.

4. **Shortest Path Optimality Condition**
   - Learn about the conditions that define the optimality of the shortest path in a graph.

5. **Negative Cycle Detection**
   - Understand how to detect negative cycles in graphs and their significance in shortest path algorithms.

6. **Difference Constraint System**
   - Explore the concept of a difference constraint system and its applications in solving optimization problems.

7. **Johnson's Algorithm and All Pairs Shortest Paths**
   - Delve into Johnson's algorithm, which efficiently computes all pairs shortest paths in a graph, even with negative edge weights.
